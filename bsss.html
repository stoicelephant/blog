      Overview: This is a quick writeup on the difference of buy-side and sell-side firms: <br><br> 
      As the name suggests buy-side firms primarily engage in the action of buying securities while sell-side firms primarily engage in selling fincancial securities to the buy-side
      as well as providing financial services. <br><br> 
      Buy Side: Something like a hedge fund (investing on behalf of clients) or a prop firm (investing on behalf of company) are often buying and selling securities on an exchange in hopes
      of making a return on the original investment<br><br> 
      Sell Side: Something like a Investment Bank or Market Maker. <br><br> 
      A great example is the Investment Banks role in helping a company to IPO. The Investment Bank provides support to the company by taking and selling the companies shares on a 
      public exchange. Market Making is a service provided by a sell-side firms to aid in providing liquidity to investors interacting with an exchange.  <br><br>
      Ovwerall, the buy-side and sell-side firms play distinct but complementary roles in the financial markets, with buy-side focusing on investment and sell-side focusing on facilitating transactions and providing services.
