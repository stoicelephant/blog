      Overview: This blog post covers the topic of how the stock market works
  </p>

    Two of the most common ways in which companies 
    raise capital are through issuing equity (stocks) 
    and undertaking debts (bonds). 
    In this pose, we will primarily focus on stocks, 
    and the journey they take from a company to an investor
    through the stock market.

        Exchanges: <br><br> 
        Exchanges are locations where investors can buy and 
        sell financial instruments. <br><br> How do retail traders
        interact with an exchange? <br><br>
        Retail traders typically need to go through a brokerage.
        A broker facilitates transactions between buyers and sellers 
        by placing trades with the exchange on behalf of thier clients. 
        <br><br>
        There are many different types of stock exchanges.
